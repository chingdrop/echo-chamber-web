# Echo Chamber Web
The repository holds the back-end application running the website - Echo Chamber. 
## Purpose
I would like to post about the results of what the internet is searching, saying, doing, etc. 
I would accomplish this goal by using the combination of a webcrawler and a tensorflow analysis engine.
